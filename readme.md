## About the project

This is a very small JS library that aims to deal with equalizing the heights of specific elements on your web page by just using a custom data attribute: `data-equal-height`.

Elements with the same values of this attribute will be considered as one group and the element in this group with the largest `offsetHeight` value will have that height value assigned to all the other elements of the same group as well.
